<h2>My Top 3 Movies of all-time<h2>

<hr />

<h3>Mrigaya</h3>
<p>Thangakan and Thilippos Muthalali (Jagannatha Varma) meet and decide to bring the hunter to the local government to find out that the government can do nothing to save the village from the inadvertent village. The late friend of the Philipose Muthalali's friend, Vettaikaran Cheruni, was sent to the letter by the son of deceased cheruni (Mammootty). The sorrow of the fiery pug that lives in the land for killing the leop becomes a nuisance to the natives,</p>
<h3>CID Moosa</h3>
<p>I do not think any Malayali born before 2010 has not watched CID Moosa atleast thrice. It is not so much about the cinematic prowess or emotinal story line which made this film such a classic. It is all about the timeless slapstick comedic moments,music and hilarious performances by the actors which has etched this piece into the hearts of malayalis and give it its endless rewatch value</p>
<h3>Bhargavi Nilayam</h3>
<P>This is acclaimed as Malayalam's first horror film. And it's very different in that the ghost never touches or kills a human. It's presence in the home leads to the circumstances and events around it. Including the revelation of the true course of events of its life. And despite that, the camera work and direction ensure our hair stands on end in some scenes. The music and performances are excellent.</P>
